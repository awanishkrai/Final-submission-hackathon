        <h2>GOVERNMENT POLICIES</h2>
        <p>According to the Unified District Information System for Education (U-DISE) 2013–14
        (Provisional), the average annual dropout rate for primary level was 4.67% and for upper primary
        level 3.13% during 2012-13, in the country. <br>The drop-out rate has been decreasing continuously
        over the years with better access to schooling facilities, improved school infrastructure and
        deployment of additional teachers under Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan.<br>
        The Central Government is implementing several schemes in collaboration with State Governments
        to ensure development in the education sector. <br>The Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan is being implemented in
        accordance with the norms and standards of the RTE Act to enhance enrolment and retention of
        children, with context- specific interventions for SC/ ST students and a multi–pronged approach for
        reducing dropout rates. <br>This includes inter-alia strengthening of school infrastructure and facilities,
        residential hostel buildings for children in habitations not covered by regular schools, provisioning
        for additional teachers, regular training of teachers, provision for free text books and uniforms to
        children.<br> The Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya Scheme provides for setting up of residential upper
        primary schools for girls from SCs, STs, OBCs and Minority communities.<br> The Mid Day Meal
        Scheme is also being implemented with a view to enhance enrolment and retention of children in
        schools.<br>
        This information was given by the Union Human Resource Development Minister, Smt. Smriti Irani
        in a written reply to the Rajya Sabha question.<br>
