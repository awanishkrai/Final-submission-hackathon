        <h2>National Education Policy </h2>
        <p>
            The National Education Policy of India 2020 (NEP 2020), which was started by the Union Cabinet of India on 29 July 2020,
            outlines the vision of new education system of India.[1] The new policy replaces the previous National Policy on
            Education, 1986.[a] The policy is a comprehensive framework for elementary education to higher as well as vocational
            training in both rural and urban India. The policy aims to transform India's education system by 2030.[2]
            
            Shortly after the release of the policy, the government clarified that no one will be forced to study any particular
            language and that the medium of instruction will not be shifted from English to any regional language.[3] The language
            policy in NEP is a broad guideline and advisory in nature; and it is up to the states, institutions, and schools to
            decide on the implementation.[4] Education in India is a Concurrent List subject.[5]
            
            On 1 August 2022, the Press Information Bureau informed that according to the "Unified District Information System for
            Education Plus" (UDISE+) 2020–21, over 28 languages are to be used in teaching and learning in grades (1–5). The
            languages are Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Konkani, Malayalam, Meitei (Manipuri), Marathi, Nepali,
            Maithili, Odia, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Sindhi, Tamil, Telugu, Urdu, English, Bodo, Khasi, Garo, Mizo, French, Hmar, Karbi,
            Santhali, Bhodi and Purgi.[6][7] New education policy is based on general formula (5+3+3+4). It is based on the student
            and is not dependent on government jobs for starting their own business. The major change of the student is learning one
            foreign language and choosing the different stream after 8th class.
